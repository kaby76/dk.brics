This repo is a revival of the Brics parser and grammar analyzer, described in this paper:

Brabrand, Claus, Robert Giegerich, and Anders MÃ¸ller. "Analyzing ambiguity of context-free grammars." Science of Computer Programming 75.3 (2010): 176-191.

https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scico.2009.11.002

The purpose of the revival is to study the code and the algorithms used to detect grammar ambiguity.

As far as the code goes, I'm not sure where I found it on the internet.
But, I had to modify the code to work with Java v24, and extended it in a couple of ways to debug
the code.

To get it to run, use VSCode: `cd grammar.sources; code .` You may need to modify class paths, etc.,
but the VSCode config is set up to debug and parse a palindromes.cfg grammar example.

Example grammars are here: https://www.brics.dk/grammar/examples.html

There are a few idiosyncrasies with this code.

* The parser only computes an abstract syntax tree if every
right-hand-side symbol of a rule is attributed, using `[ foobar ]` after a nonterminal or terminal symbol. Apparently,
the code looks for explicitly named symbols. Otherwise, the code just parses and returns a mostly empty tree.

* There are both graphical and command-line interfaces. In addition, there's a web server for running the code.
However, I found both the graphical and web server UI cumbersome to use, especially when trying to perform "edit/compile/run/debug"
development. So I used the command-line interface mostly.

* I had to change quite a bit of the code, renaming `Sometype varN `, where `N` is some integer, into a realistic,
purposeful name. I couldn't debug and fix the code otherwise. It
seems strange that variable names are `varN`, likely the result of generating Java code
from another language, or because of purposeful obfuscation.

* `Parser.parse()` computes only a single AST for an ambiguous parse.
Again, this seems rather strange because the parser algorithm
could easily handle this
and because the code also checks for grammar ambiguity
via the heuristics described in the paper.

* I found the `print()` method for printing an AST to be completely impossible to read. So, I wrote the routine
`myprint()` to print out the AST as an indented structure, using the names of the nodes of the nonterminals.
This output is much simpler to visualize and check the tree structure.

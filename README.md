This repo is a revival of the Brics parser and grammar analyzer, described in this paper:

Brabrand, Claus, Robert Giegerich, and Anders MÃ¸ller. "Analyzing ambiguity of context-free grammars." Science of Computer Programming 75.3 (2010): 176-191.

https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scico.2009.11.002

The purpose of the revival is to study the code and the algorithms used to detect grammar ambiguity.

As far as the code goes, I'm not sure where I found it on the internet.
But, I had to modify the code to work with Java v24, and extended it in a couple of ways to debug
the code.

To get it to run, use VSCode: `cd grammar.sources; code .` You may need to modify class paths, etc.,
but the VSCode config is set up to debug and parse a palindromes.cfg grammar example.

Example grammars are here: https://www.brics.dk/grammar/examples.html

There are a few idiosyncrasies with this code.

* The parser only computes an abstract syntax tree if every
right-hand-side symbol of a rule is attributed, using `[ foobar ]` after a nonterminal or terminal symbol. Apparently,
the code looks for explicitly named symbols. Otherwise, the code just parses and returns a mostly empty tree.

* There are both graphical and command-line interfaces. In addition, there's a web server for running the code.
However, I found both the graphical and web server UI cumbersome to use, especially when trying to perform "edit/compile/run/debug"
development. So I used the command-line interface mostly.

* I had to change quite a bit of the code, renaming `Sometype varN `, where `N` is some integer, into a realistic,
purposeful name. I couldn't debug and fix the code otherwise.

* `Parser.parse()` computes only a single AST for an ambiguous parse.

* I found the `print()` method for printing an AST to be completely impossible to read. So, I wrote the routine
`myprint()` to print out the AST as an indented structure, using the names of the nodes of the nonterminals.
This output is much simpler to visualize and check the tree structure.
